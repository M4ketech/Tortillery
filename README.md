# Tortillery

**Tortillery** It is a *custom* firmware (still in trial version) for **Artillery Sidewinder X4 Pro** y **X4 Plus** printers (also including versions **S1**).

This project replaces the original firmware with:
- A more recent Armbian. 
- The latest version of Klipper (v13).  
- Removal of all problematic dependencies from the original firmware.  
- Fixed known bugs (such as Z-offset issues).
- A custom display firmware that includes most of the original features.  
- Multi Languages

Tortillery is fully customizable and includes basic files for print-ready operation.  

The ability to resume printing after a power outage is not included. If you experience power issues, using a UPS is recommended.  

In addition, we have prepared an installation guide to make the process easier for you.

## Acknowledgments

Although the project began over a year ago, we've only been able to complete it in the last few months. This work would not have been possible without the support of: 

- **Urtzi**, **Repuk**, **Vin** (for their contributions to the Telegram group).  
- **Redrathnure**, for its fantastic [Armbian no oficial](https://github.com/redrathnure/armbian-mkspi).  
- **Joakimtoe**, for its firmware version for the Neptune 3 Pro display ([KlipperLCD](https://github.com/joakimtoe/KlipperLCD)).  

Thanks to all of them for making Tortillery a reality.
